    <span class="post-text"><p>
Joining a bootcamp for web development has been something I've thought about
in the past and, somehow, just never really got around to looking into, let
alone applying for. That all changed about 3 months ago. I had recently moved
back to Central Kentucky after about a year of work in the automotive
industry in Nasville, TN and to say I was glad to be home would be the
understatement of a lifetime. Little did I know just how quickly things
would progress once I stumbled upon the Awesome Inc website randomly one day.
</p>
<p>

The application process was <i>extremely</i> thorough, consisting of multiple
challenges (some beginner coding related, others more of a thought
process exercise) that had to be completed for a chance at acceptance
into the program. I had already completed my application process the
day of the open house available to the public about 2 months prior
to the planned start date of the bootcamp, and had scheduled my interview
for that same day.
</p>

<p>
	
The interview was actually really fun. It was set up just like any job
interview I've ever been to, but the questions asked got a little more
personal than in my previous experiences. It seemed the team at Awesome
Inc University didn't just want capable students, they were also looking
for individuals that wanted to make a difference. Besides the questions
there was also a technical portion which involved playing a game on a
tablet called Lightbot. It seemed strange to me at first until I realized
that the game relies on you to interperet the landscape, plan accordingly
and then execute your moves to be successful, an ability I have come to
realize is extremely important for bootcamp. I was confident, but with 
only 10-15 people being selected for the program, I was extremely humble 
about my chances of actually getting in.
</p>

<p>

Congratulations! That was the first word of the email I received roughly a month
before the bootcamp start date. I remember opening the email and being too afraid
to actually scroll down to see what was written for at least 5 minutes. 
The next month consisted of completing pre-work challenges, watching video
content, and generally familiarizing myself with some of the more commonly used
current technologies associated with web development (or refamiliarizing myself
in the case of HTML and CSS). The prework was much more challenging than those
from the application process and in the end I feel they were designed to 
introduce all of us to the concept on "learning how to learn". It may not
sound like that big of a deal, but web development and technology in general
is in a constant state of Kaizen (or continuous improvement, I can thank
Toyota Motor Manufacturing for knowing that one) and requires developers to
always be searching for or creating new and easier ways to perform the task
at hand.
</p>

<p>
I'll cover what my first week was like in my next post. It would be putting
it <i>very</i> lightly to say that the pre-work was designed so we could all
"hit the ground running" the first week, but more on that next time!
