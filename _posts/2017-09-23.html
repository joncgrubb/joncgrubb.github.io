<p>
Joining a bootcamp for web development has been something I've thought about
in the past and, somehow, just never really got around to looking into, let
alone applying for. That all changed about 3 months ago. I had recently moved
back to Central Kentucky after about a year of work in the automotive
industry in Nasville, TN and to say I was glad to be home would be the
understatement of a lifetime. Little did I know just how quickly things
would progress once I stumbled upon the Awesome Inc website randomly one day.

The application process was _extremely_ thorough, consisting of multiple
challenges (some beginner coding related, others more of a thought
process exercise) that had to be completed for a chance at acceptance
into the program. I had already completed my application process the
day of the open house available to the public about 2 months prior
to the planned start date of the bootcamp, and had scheduled my interview
for that same day. I was confident, but with only 10-15 people being
selected for the program, I was extremely humble about my chances of 
actually getting in.

Congratulations! That was the first word of the email I received roughly a month
before the bootcamp start date. I remember opening the email and being too afraid
to actually scroll down to see what was written for at least 5 minutes. 
The next month consisted of completing pre-work challenges, watching video
content, and generally familiarizing myself with some of the more commonly used
current technologies associated with web development (or refamiliarizing myself
in the case of HTML and CSS).

I'll cover what my first week was like in my next post. It would be putting
it _very_ lightly to say that the pre-work was designed so we could all
"hit the ground running" the first week, but more on that next time!
